          We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative
          measures to protect personal data within our organization.
          Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to
          be completely secure, and transmission of information via the Internet
          is not completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your
          interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that
          the security of any account you might have with us has been
          compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by
          contacting us.
